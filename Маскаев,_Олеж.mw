'''Маскаев Олег ''' ({{lang-ru|Олег Александрович Маскаев}}; шачсь 2[[ Марков]] [[1969]], [[Абай ош]]са, [[ Карагандань аймак]]са,[[ Казахскяй ССР]]са,[[ Советонь Соткс]]са)- Рузонь тевонь[[ боксерсь]] ди ётай [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[стака-утяма чемпионсь]]. 
==Боксонь карьера==
Маскаев, шачсь шахтонь покодень тналса, ушедат сонь карьерась 1980 кизат кода[[эсь тии боксер]] [[Рузмастор]]са, [[ Советонь Соткс]] still existed. He was the champion of the [[Soviet Red Army]] and later the national cup winner. His professional boxing career began in 1993.

Oleg is known for his powerful punch in his right hand: he has knocked out former [[WBO]] heavyweight challenger [[Derrick Jefferson]], contender [[Alex Stewart]], and former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]] (twice). However, he is also noted for a suspect [[chin (boxing)|chin]] that was evident in his knockout losses to contenders [[Oliver McCall]], [[David Tua]], [[Kirk Johnson]], [[Lance Whitaker]], and [[Corey Sanders]]. 

His most famous victories have been his two wins over [[Hasim Rahman]]. Maskaev knocked Rahman off balance, sending his rival out of the ring in the 8th round on [[November 6]], [[1999]]. This fight is also notable for the famous "chair incident", in which noted referee, [[Steve Smoger]], who was backup referee for this fight, was struck in the head by a thrown chair from a fan who was later arrested. 

Later, he fought Rahman again and defeated him for the WBC heavyweight title by knockout in the 12th round on [[August 12]], [[2006]]. His second win over Rahman was preceded by a streak of victories that helped rejuvenate Maskaev's career and earned him the "Comeback fighter of the Year" award in [[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]] magazine in 2006.

Maskaev won his first title defense against Peter Okhello on [[December 10]], [[2006]], by unanimous decision. After this bout, Maskaev remained unchallenged for over a year. 

Maskaev fought against [[Samuel Peter]] for the WBC Heavyweight title on [[March 8]], [[2008]] and was doing well in the early rounds despite Peter's repeated rabbit punching and the referee's warnings. In the 5th round Maskaev landed some of his best shots flush on his opponents chin but Peter walked through them and this visibly shook Oleg. He lost 5 of the 6 rounds with Peter winning by [[TKO]] with only 3 seconds remaining in the last round on what some have called a premature stoppage.

Currently, He is promoted by Dennis Rappaport of New York, and will be seen in many upcoming fights.  Dennis is currently working with Oleg, to prepare for his next bout in Red Square which will take place on September 6, 2008.

==Nationality==
Maskaev was born in [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Russians|Russian]] parents. He has lived in the [[United States|U.S.]] since 1999 with his wife, Svetlana, and four daughters. He acquired US [[citizenship]] in 2004.  He currently resides in [[West Sacramento]], [[California]].  Before his first encounter with Hasim Rahman in 2006, he said "I would say I'm a proud Russian-American. So right now, I'm a citizen of America, of [the] United States... Whoever is going to win is going to be American."<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=rafael_dan&id=2545745 espn.com]</ref>
In the run-up to his title defense against Peter Okhello, he stated regarding his citizenship: "Russian. I don't want to talk about that anymore. I will walk to the ring under the Russian flag and Russian anthem as I'm now a Russian citizen."<ref>[http://www.fightnews.com/sukachev21.htm fightnews.com]</ref>
Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] granted him Russian citizenship on December 9th, 2006.<ref>[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/12/09/rusbox/ lenta.ru]</ref>
